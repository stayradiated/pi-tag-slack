## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR.
- Fill out the PR template completely.
- Ensure CI passes (build, lint, test) before requesting review.
- Add tests for new functionality when possible.
- Update the README if you're adding user-facing features.

## Code Style

This project uses **ESLint** and **Prettier** to enforce consistent code style:

- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes
- Semicolons
- ES modules (`import`/`export`)

Run `pnpm run format` to auto-format your code before committing.
